Turkey is very exceptioanal country in point of tax and legal requirements point. It has very different and local procedures. However, APAY is trying to process bookings according to global procedure which Turkey does not fit in. For example Turkey has very detailed return invoice process because of e-invoice, however APAY just ignores it and tries to apply global process which does not work for Turkey at all. When we raised issue to higher level people, we do not even receive responds. Previous BPSC team was great but since IBM has taken over APAY, it is very dissapointing. Work quality is very low.",

To avoid a greater level of stress, we could formulate this response better, for example: &quot;Mr. supplier, we find that there is a delay in the processing of your invoice, to better serve you, kindness, forward a copy of the NF to the email and etc. ... &quot;containing all those rules.",

The trick is getting the PO correct and the proper approver contacted to even start the clock.  Vendors, and those of us that have to answer them, are very frustrated with not being able to even find effective help.  If you consider how much time people throughout Dow, not just PtP, are spending on these problems, the cost far outweighs anything that was saved by moving the transactional work to IBM.  We need real troubleshooting contacts since we have to try and fix all the internal issues.  Honestly, all I should have to do is enter a requisition and then approve payments against the PO.  PtP should be the experts at getting the system to provide Dow with a cost effective means of paying our vendors!",

Please educate Sourcing and others with PtP work processes that are visible and clear and able to be found and understood. Please work to streamline the service level between PtP IBM and the rest of PtP - if the processes work and are agile, I shouldn't be able to clearly see a difference in the level of service. Please work to group issues and trends together at a higher level so that escalation focal points are not so bogged down in the day to day that we are missing opportunities to fix more root causes or understand how to prevent them. Please explain the different roles in Midland PtP and the projects and work they are doing - if we are not supposed to use them for PtP escalation, what things are they working on? If we are truly going to think end to end, provide training opportunities or \"day in the life\" opportunities for Sourcing and PtP to better understand and support each other. The culture is still very divided. Give Sourcing better visibly and access to the PtP metrics so we can understand their scorecard and how to assist and impact the measurement. Come up with a way to highlight the complexities to give greater understanding to outsiders of PtP . . . the morale is very negative because nobody is hearing about solution for what isn't working, and we're also not hearing what IS working and all the good things PtP is doing. In general, they get a very bad rap but there are good things happening and in the works and those things need to be understood and developed so that others feel PtP is an integral part of the overall process. First though, the tickets must be resolved correctly and timely and we must stop waiting weeks for resolutions, or spending so much time emailing PtP helpdesk with issues such as \"I can see where vendor submitted this 6/4 via email, why is the system baseline date 6/14 - please update.\" ",

I cannot say how this might be improved but I do believe a better understanding of the Ariba issues, the invoices being requested by the suppliers at the time of shipment (the shipment is in transit) and the workflow system is activated because there is no Goods Receipt due to the shipment being in transit. I takes time for all the steps of an order to be ready to process.  Paying invoice with no approval or GR and some that will not release payment on orders that appear to have everything in order. I think a better understanding of the entire process on both sides would benefit all of us.

Also I am still finding that vendors are not getting the full remittance information needed in order for they to know what invoices are being paid for, which causes additional confusion & frustration.  Vendors are claiming that they cannot see certain POs in Ariba, and end up submitting invoices manually.  PTP will just write them back asking for the vendor to submit via the Ariba Portal, which they can't since they can't even see the PO.  Same goes for Ariba POs with ERS established vendors.  PTP will tell them to submit invoice via the portal, but they should have been paid upon goods receipt as they are ERS.  Seems that PTP is not even looking at the PO before responding.  ",

Technically we are not supposed to receive material or begin labor services until we have a PO in hand.  When we are working on a critical piece of equipment and we need material or services ASAP.  Purchasing is ALWAYS a challenge when generating a PO.  I have noticed more issues with material PO's vs. labor PO's",

There should not be a requirement to check with the Category Leader or an Escalation Point to see if an overdue payment can be completed immediately.

I have provided feedback using the \u201csurveymonkey\u201d tool at the end of the closing of the ticket to voice my concerns and suggested improvements. \u2022\tI submit all issues through FUSAPHD \u2013 then a ticket is created.  And when I need to respond to the ticket it is recommended to send an email to FUSAPHD. \u2022\tThose resolving the ticket do not know the process \u2013 it takes multiple emails to obtain the correct information and in the meantime tickets are closed/reopened and the true resolution is delayed. \u2022\tEmail ticket examples attached: o\tVendor\u2019s bank info needs to change.  As of today it is still not complete. o\tTicket resolution \u2013 does not include the vendor name, PO number, etc.  All the tracking information that I include in my original email is not in the reply. o\tVaxServe invoice payment issue \u2013 did not request an update to the PO  - but rather to look at nonpayment of invoices.  The response did not make sense from the help desk. o\tReached out to the EMEAI help desk to obtain information on a process and the response was very vague as to where to find the solution.   o\tVaxServ vendor charges a federal excise tax.

It increase our list of  provision.   6) critical invoice, payment term, not changed  even request on mail.  ( e.g. Contractor, Security payment).  7) Suggestion of employees for  entry, not accepted, Unhelpful talk on the phone.  8) Compliance related payment, which need to pay, before due not taken seriously on mail, need to call helpdesk.   9) Invoice which require data, missing, bills being directly rejected & send back to invoice to vendor. These small changes can be done, if mail can be send to us, revised invoice can be asked from vendor & scan can invoice can be forwarded on mail, as per current process invoice send back to vendor, vendor makes necessary correction, then invoice has forwarded to iron mountain for scanning & then booking done. Vendor has to struggle for payment.   10) New vendor creation request created, vendor coding team forwarded request to tax team for Tax code. They have not received details from tax team in two days. Vendor coding team closed ticket. now need to create request again, this is complete waste of time.   Suggestion  1) Remove this system of sending invoice to IRON Mountain, as per earlier system invoice being scan at plant level & being posted on site for processing. This can be solved issue of invoice being misplaced.   Thanks.  ",

    "Comments_1": "1) Invoice misplaced, 2 Invoice forwarded, one bill booked, second misplaced.   2) Invoice being asked again to resend, in this transaction more than 1 month. delayed in booking invoice, Payment term is 6o day so vendor will get the payment after 3 months.   3) Invoice blocked, delay or no response, why invoice being blocked for payment.  4) Every time need to call, on phone they will replay, invoice in queue, we will replay on mail.  5) Invoice forwarded on 13th July booked in the month of August 2018. It increase our list of  provision.   6) critical invoice, payment term, not changed  even request on mail.  ( e.g. Contractor, Security payment).  7) Suggestion of employees for  entry, not accepted, Unhelpful talk on the phone.  8) Compliance related payment, which need to pay, before due not taken seriously on mail, need to call helpdesk.   9) Invoice which require data, missing, bills being directly rejected & send back to invoice to vendor. These small changes can be done, if mail can be send to us, revised invoice can be asked from vendor & scan can invoice can be forwarded on mail, as per current process invoice send back to vendor, vendor makes necessary correction, then invoice has forwarded to iron mountain for scanning & then booking done. Vendor has to struggle for payment.   10) New vendor creation request created, vendor coding team forwarded request to tax team for Tax code. They have not received details from tax team in two days. Vendor coding team closed ticket. now need to create request again, this is complete waste of time.   Suggestion  1) Remove this system of sending invoice to IRON Mountain, as per earlier system invoice being scan at plant level & being posted on site for processing. This can be solved issue of invoice being misplaced.   Thanks.  ",

I don't think it's our job to police postings to POs, but we have to when it effects the costing on our materials for our businesses we support.  Some errors we've come across: wrong unit of measure posted, posted to the wrong item (posts duties instead of freight or material) against the PO.  Frequently I see postings as duties when it's all within the US...... there should be no duties, this is when it crosses countries!  It seems like they don't know what duties are.  Can you provide better training?  Can you have a support SME on the APAY side to help them with things they don't know how to post, so they can get it right the first time? ",

Provide better training and error resolution training to your group.  Have a team lead or SME that the APAY folks can go to if they need help with a correction.  Communicate better with status and error resolution with impacted cost accountant/plant/PO requisitioner.  Send a communication to PO requsitioner if there is an issue paying the invoice on a PO and what the error is.  My plant has been having trouble once you moved them on the elemica system with getting their vendors paid.  They come back to cost accountants to help and we can't do anything because we are not in APAY nor have access.

Planners waste too much time trying to resolve invoice discrepancies, usually for very small quantities or dollar amounts.  I appreciate the goal of perfection, but we are not staffed to be perfect.  There is clearly a mismatch in expectations vs. ability to meet those expectations. Too much time is wasted, people are very frustrated by the tight tolerances.  A simple solution?  Broaden the tolerances for invoice discrepancies until operations organizations are given resources and training to more accurately match invoices with actuals.",

Can&#39;t find the person in charge, or need to go through a complicated process to find the person in charge. The reaction is not generally slow, the bureaucracy is strong, and the business is not refined. Have problems with the end user. PTP does not seem to provide services to the production team, but the production team is the PTP service. If PTP is only a mechanical transfer order, then PTP has become a part of the production efficiency, perhaps without PTP, the efficiency may be higher. In addition, the responsibilities between PTP and SOURCING are unclear, and they are mutually motivated. In the end, the user has to do all the things himself, from taking the quotation - urging the order - urging the goods - receiving the goods. Especially in the quotation, users can go to get the quotation, but if the user is a warehouse administrator, there are a lot of purchase requests every day, you need to purchase the quotation, and should not refuse the amount below a certain amount. . Why should we divide PTP and purchase SOURCING? For users, it is necessary to purchase services, one-to-one to find the corresponding person, let the user find PTP for a while, find SOURCING for a while, it is difficult for users to distinguish PTP and SOURCING, the procurement organization is too complicated. It is. After the user establishes the purchase application, as long as the technical specifications and parameters of the purchased materials are specified in the purchase application, the goods can be received, and the subsequent supplier quotation, transfer order, expired undelivered, etc. should all be Purchasing is responsible.",

Can&#39;t find the person in charge, or need to go through a complicated process to find the person in charge. The reaction is not generally slow, the bureaucracy is strong, and the business is not refined. Have problems with the end user. PTP does not seem to provide services to the production team, but the production team is the PTP service. If PTP is only a mechanical transfer order, then PTP has become a part of the production efficiency, perhaps without PTP, the efficiency may be higher. In addition, the responsibilities between PTP and SOURCING are unclear, and they are mutually motivated. In the end, the user has to do all the things himself, from taking the quotation - urging the order - urging the goods - receiving the goods. Especially in the quotation, users can go to get the quotation, but if the user is a warehouse administrator, there are a lot of purchase requests every day, you need to purchase the quotation, and should not refuse the amount below a certain amount. . Why should we divide PTP and purchase SOURCING? For users, it is necessary to purchase services, one-to-one to find the corresponding person, let the user find PTP for a while, find SOURCING for a while, it is difficult for users to distinguish PTP and SOURCING, the procurement organization is too complicated. It is. After the user establishes the purchase application, as long as the technical specifications and parameters of the purchased materials are specified in the purchase application, the goods can be received, and the subsequent supplier quotation, transfer order, expired undelivered, etc. should all be Purchasing is responsible.",

However, Venders / Suppliers do not necessarily agree with the purchasing system of Dow and take action, and considerable confusion occurred on each business side in the new procedure method. (Example: Blanket PO is suddenly faxed / e-mailed to Vender.) Changes affecting business partners in this manner should also reflect the voices of the workers (persons in charge) until execution. For example, in Japan, Government agency, Hospital etc have no custom to receive PO. Because it is already decided, even if a PO is sent, it becomes unnecessary and troublesome, and complaints / inquiries will be made to the person in charge of each business. Please carry out the procedure method considering the business customs of each country.",

The checklists that are being worked on are not coordinated with the stakeholders (here TES organization) and hamper our processes instead of working hand in hand with us. Objection and suggestions for improvement are ignored. Responsibilities that were previously in the purchasing department were &quot;delegated&quot; to the requester without approval. In my opinion, the checklists should urgently be revised. The extra work that has been done through the process changes in the TES organization is enormous. Frequently changing personnel at PtP Operations makes it necessary to check and keep track of all the steps that a purchase requisition goes through until the invoice is paid. In the past, it was normal for this process to work. PtP monitoring mechanisms must be installed to guarantee this. For example, PtP Operations has to remember that orders from PR are not sent to suppliers because of lack of authorization of employees, not the Requisitor.",

Formal requirements are handled well and quickly (eg change partners, prices, validity) it does not get to the root cause of the error and acted proactively. So we go from error to error without any learning effect. If Operations should fix only formal errors, there must be a parent support that acts proactively. It can not be that we as the users of newly introduced systems (ARIBA) also have to ensure that the table settings and master data are correct, of which we actually know nothing! If a problem is more complex, ie several groups are involved, I have to coordinate as a requester, why? I have a problem and in the end there is a solution. Should I care about who worked on the solution? Why do I have to open a new ticket for each step?",

Each new supplier should be set up in the Dow system (all table settings) so that every potential user can communicate with him via Ariba and all documents are transported without any problems.

    "Comments_1": "Extremely dissatisfied and disappointed with the PTP service in terms of payment to vendors. Uncountable requests and e-mails are sent to the help desk over and over without any reply. When we phone, the person taking the call \"opens a ticket\" which is left endlessly without feedback. Only after countless calls, days and even weeks is a feedback provided, most often to say the invoice remains blocked due to some other unfounded \"issue\". Again, the request is \"escalated\" without the possibility of us talking to anyone in PTP except the person at the helpdesk.  Finally, after weeks or even months and having to ask leaders for  intervention is payment of invoices done.  Dow image is extremely bad because of this, but worse is the fact that vendors REFUSE to sell to Dow until past invoices are paid putting at risk manufacturing operations!  In addition, late payment to customs agents and government authorities (ex. VAT and taxes, customs duties, etc), result in fines and interest along with audits from Government Finance dept because Dow is not performing as legally required. How to improve:  Pay vendor invoices in a timely manner. Answer Dow and vendor calls and provide feedback in a timely manner. Do not block invoices without having a real founded reason for it and if so, inform vendor immediately. The vendor has provided a service or sent the material and is entitled to know why their invoice is being blocked. Have trained personnel who know the countries' languages so they can understand what the invoices say. Most often invoices are blocked because PTP do not understand what some word means and/misunderstand it.   ",

    "Comments_1": "Extremely dissatisfied and disappointed with the PTP service in terms of payment to vendors. Uncountable requests and e-mails are sent to the help desk over and over without any reply. When we phone, the person taking the call \"opens a ticket\" which is left endlessly without feedback. Only after countless calls, days and even weeks is a feedback provided, most often to say the invoice remains blocked due to some other unfounded \"issue\". Again, the request is \"escalated\" without the possibility of us talking to anyone in PTP except the person at the helpdesk.  Finally, after weeks or even months and having to ask leaders for  intervention is payment of invoices done.  Dow image is extremely bad because of this, but worse is the fact that vendors REFUSE to sell to Dow until past invoices are paid putting at risk manufacturing operations!  In addition, late payment to customs agents and government authorities (ex. VAT and taxes, customs duties, etc), result in fines and interest along with audits from Government Finance dept because Dow is not performing as legally required. How to improve:  Pay vendor invoices in a timely manner. Answer Dow and vendor calls and provide feedback in a timely manner. Do not block invoices without having a real founded reason for it and if so, inform vendor immediately. The vendor has provided a service or sent the material and is entitled to know why their invoice is being blocked. Have trained personnel who know the countries' languages so they can understand what the invoices say. Most often invoices are blocked because PTP do not understand what some word means and/misunderstand it.   ",

When a PR is blocked with no text, and I call the PtP for them to tell me what is wrong with it and they cant tell me because they don't know, there are no notes and I can't talk to the person that blocked it, it is a waste of my time, their time, and we are wasting our vendors time waiting for us to send them a PO to begin work that should have started weeks ago but hasn't because the PR's are magically blocked over and over again.  There is zero ownership of any type of helpfulness or resolution thinking and there is no follow up.   When tickets are created, they don't reference anything about the original problem so if you have multiple issues, (Unpaid invoice) and email the PtP helpdesk, they come back with a ticket number and no reference to anything regarding the invoice itself.  There is zero tracking history because email conversations are not included in threads so you have to explain yourself over and over.  ",

We are charged to follow the processes as determined by PtP and in the other hand they are not following their responsibilities. The agreed deadline is not being met and are not paying the vouchers on the correct date. Dow image with suppliers is very bad and they are failing us. We receive a several calls from suppliers asking for their payment causing great embarrassment and, in addition, the significant number of hours we lost. Another example problem is when we need to know if an invoice has been paid. We need to open a ticket, after 48 hours we receive the reply that the invoice will be paid on the Xth day; then the ticket is closed. From my point of view, the ticket has not yet been resolved, as the invoice has not yet been paid. The ticket should be closed only when payment is made. The payment date has come and once again they have not paid. We have to reopen the ticket for a new response. There are about 10 emails for the same subject and it takes a long time to solve it. We have to improve the process and make it work properly and effectively. We expect from you is that you analyze all these problems and find solutions with IBM. It is unacceptable to work under these conditions. ",

    "Comments_1": "The problem we are facing is recurrent in several areas. I dare say that all those involved with vouchers requests and purchase orders are faced with this difficulty. We are charged to follow the processes as determined by PtP and in the other hand they are not following their responsibilities. The agreed deadline is not being met and are not paying the vouchers on the correct date. Dow image with suppliers is very bad and they are failing us. We receive a several calls from suppliers asking for their payment causing great embarrassment and, in addition, the significant number of hours we lost. Another example problem is when we need to know if an invoice has been paid. We need to open a ticket, after 48 hours we receive the reply that the invoice will be paid on the Xth day; then the ticket is closed. From my point of view, the ticket has not yet been resolved, as the invoice has not yet been paid. The ticket should be closed only when payment is made. The payment date has come and once again they have not paid. We have to reopen the ticket for a new response. There are about 10 emails for the same subject and it takes a long time to solve it. We have to improve the process and make it work properly and effectively. We expect from you is that you analyze all these problems and find solutions with IBM. It is unacceptable to work under these conditions. ",

I have been on hold more then 2-3 hours on multiply occasions. When the help desk resources is this backed up, should tell you something. Way to complicated to get payments processed. Again, this is the Ariba side of payment!!",

Also the PTP ticker submission process is a joke, you submit and there is no way to view it in the system and no feedback to the facility.  I was submitting invoices for over 3 months, for a vendor and PTP was not processing them, and not providing feedback that the vendor was on SES, but the SES process was not created for a new site nor had a contract.  The vendor went up paid for over 8 months and canx there were service with the site.  We need a way to stream line the vendor coding creation to seeing where a vendor has all the required data, waiting on a sourcing agent who manages 30+ sites is ridiculous.  ",

Ticket number should always come by email.  3) Received response that problem will be resolved in 3 weeks and to escalate if there are issues within 7 days.  Obviously I will not know if there are any issues until 3 weeks are up, so a new request has to be put in with all previous knowledge lost.  This has happened twice.   4) The high number of issues with getting vendors paid contributes to this feedback.  Seems like PtP needs to be called on very PO.  Something needs to change.  ",

Maybe that's because I haven't gotten used to how it's supposed to work with Dow's procurement model, but sometimes just finding a contact can be difficult.  All of the sourcing managers seem stressed beyond what's manageable.  There has been so much turnover that it seems like all knowledge has been lost.  I needed to make a vendor master change recently so that I could get PO's going to the correct email address (instead of fax). I asked the sourcing manager \"is there any other person purchasing from this vendor?  I don't want to make a vendor master change that could impact someone else\" meaning, I didn't want my change to make their PO's go to my contact, if they didn't want it to. They couldn't tell me the answer. They didn't know.  And that blew my mind, so I made the change anyway, and so far so good.  PTP helpdesk - it seems like there is little to no urgency on behalf of the PTP Helpdesk.  When there is something that I need to be done, I expect that my note to the PTP Helpdesk will be handled in a timely manner, and if questions arise, I would expect to have an email back asking their question.  It shouldn't just sit there, for me to follow up on over and over again.  I entered in a req the other day.  It was set with emergency status because we needed a part to resolve an imploding drum issue, and it took 4 days to get the req converted.  No one reached out to me with questions/comments on the req.  I think it goes without saying, but what is the point in entering a priority on the req if no priority is taken. ",

Many issues that are straight forward take multiple emails and require a lot of comments before they issues are resolved. I've seen line items that cost $200 in the quote have the PO's issued with the price 10 times as high.  We have PO's that should be sent to one vendor be sent to a completely different vendor.  It usually takes a while before the end  user is aware and this causes all sorts of issues with scheduling work.  ",

The Escalation Matrix contact list turnover (burn out) rate in PO expeditors,  purchasing, accounts payable and strategic sourcing is ridiculous. Provide support and staffing for the folks we escalate issues to. We need our vendors paid for work previously performed, so when I have to call a vendor in the middle of the night or on the weekend with \"E\" priority work they will respond. Submitting an \"E\" priority purchase requisition should not require a PTP case and Three phone calls to request that the PO is released. Especially when the PO is for $5,000 or less. Give the DOW Contract Administrators more access to change validity dates, update PO wording for shipping instructs or simple text errors. We need ME22N (ME22N Lite) & COCKPIT 1 access. Contractors have better access than DOW Contract Administrators and we don't charge a fee for each transaction we perform. We should not have to handle a PR/PO 8-12 times to get a vendor paid.

    "Comments_1": "We need better training and support for Vendors using Ariba for SES processing. The Ariba functional mailbox needs the support of an Ariba helpdesk, including a phone number. STOP hiding from the vendors and dumping the work on the Contract Administrators. Ariba functional mailbox tells me it is an ERS issue and ERS functional mailbox tells me it is an Ariba issue. The Escalation Matrix contact list turnover (burn out) rate in PO expeditors,  purchasing, accounts payable and strategic sourcing is ridiculous. Provide support and staffing for the folks we escalate issues to. We need our vendors paid for work previously performed, so when I have to call a vendor in the middle of the night or on the weekend with \"E\" priority work they will respond. Submitting an \"E\" priority purchase requisition should not require a PTP case and Three phone calls to request that the PO is released. Especially when the PO is for $5,000 or less. Give the DOW Contract Administrators more access to change validity dates, update PO wording for shipping instructs or simple text errors. We need ME22N (ME22N Lite) & COCKPIT 1 access. Contractors have better access than DOW Contract Administrators and we don't charge a fee for each transaction we perform. We should not have to handle a PR/PO 8-12 times to get a vendor paid. We want to be able to help Dow and the vendors we work with to succeed.  \"Many hands make light work.\"",

I think we need to have direct contacts for major issues. If it were just to update the validity date on a PO most of the time the response is quick and easy. If the issue is above and beyond the day to day we need a highly skilled individual to help. I think additional training is needed for these individuals. Also, once you finally find someone who may understand your issue you never know if you will be able to talk back with that same person. They are afraid to give you direct contact with them which makes our jobs so much harder because if the issue is not resolved properly and promptly then it's basically like starting your ticket all over again. In my personal experience, it seems as though individuals are only trained on specific items so when you call regarding an issue they don't know then they send you to a person who is suppose to know but sometimes is not the correct group because they didn't truly understand your problem. I think we should have a designated person at each site that could help with these issues and/or know direct contacts to escalate to. Not only is it frustrating for Dow employees to get help, it is also frustrating to inform the company over and over that you are trying to get the issue resolved but having to talk with multiple people and sometimes put in multiple tickets regarding the same issue.

Contacting the PTP helpdesk or submitting a ticket can be too difficult to explain to someone who doesn't understand the issue. Also, for example this is a huge issue we ran across this year so far, PO's not being flagged ERS on framework PO's. We checked the PO's at the beginning of the year and then all of a sudden they aren't ERS and we have processed SES against them. Now even though the SES are approved they won't pay out. First I was told they would pay out which I knew wasn't correct because that function never worked before and then I was told I had to resubmit all the SES which was hundreds. Finally after multiple calls, emails back and forth with multiple different people, they were able to pay out. There has to be an easier way than waiting 3 months for this decision to be made. There should be steps to release the funds once the PO is corrected.  ",

Creates a mess and uneccessary e-mails. Anwering the requestor, APAY team may insert ticket number in subject of body of the message  - each PtP employee should have signature with name and job title. Currently I never know whom I talk to. Are these are different people anwering last week and today?  - requests with a word 'urgent' in subject should be handled within couple of hours and not for days/weeks  - if APAY does not know how to fix the issue, they should ask for SME assistance and not just reply 'we don't know what is the root-cause for that. Please let us know if need smth else' and close ticket",

On the same day a mail to FTNHelp is sent a ticket number but only after a week, this ticket will be forwarded to the right place for editing and there it often takes more than a week until the case is resolved. Since often with the missing raw materials an operational shutdown threatens it takes simply too long.",

Unit-of-Measure errors are the most common, but errors also occur where the invoice contains multiple lines for individual batches of the same product and they enter information from the wrong line, not realizing that at the end of the invoice (two or three pages down) is the grand total line that is the correct answer.",

For example, one supplier has send 2 invoices. Only one invoice has been handled and the other one not. I did follow up and they told me that they did not even see the second invoice on the email (how is that possible) they told me that the invoice will be handled now but meanwhile the supplier is waiting for the payment and this can take another few weeks again. They even mentioned on the email, that the supplier needs to send the invoice to: ftnapch@dow.com and this way the invoice will be paid more quickly. I told them the supplier did send the invoice to the correct email address and I have the impression they are not checking the emails carefully.  ",

From the outside looking in it appears those individuals are following a script based on high level basics.  Appear to have little to no knowledge of what they are actually processing.   Supervisory level in India and Poland have responded to specific issues escalated over months.  Their service level exceeding those initially contacted.  If question is with regard to Dow, Accenture, IBM personnel SAP knowledge is severely lacking. With regard to internal designs and cross-functional designs.   ",

HELP should be defined as tangible results. ie; requisition created, PO created, supplier has the PO, GR is visible, Invoice is paid in a matter of hours or days.  Not weeks or months. HELP is not productive as a service now ticket created by PTP that a user cannot open. With notes and comments populated only by PTP Ops personnel which use cannot view.  - Absolutely agree that HELP no longer can be a person on a phone.  But the current ticket process in use is not efficient.   HELP means results and if a process creates results there is no need to talk to a person.  ",

    "Comments_1": "Direction for the last 18-24 months has been to create solutions that address Procurement goals with minimal stakeholder input. But with maximum impact to stakeholder by shifting  responsibility for executing processes and SAP design that their function DOES NOT OWN.   Transformation was executed as hard stop of requisition processing at the front end in order to facilitate success with invoice payment at end of process.  A solution HEAVY on end users as the primary mechanism to generate the data or address the process that the \"transformation\" is dependent on.  i.e. requisition line item blocking on the front end. Automation appears to be dependent on front-end manual loading by users; with the layer of knowledgeable Procurement process personnel severely depleted. Those individuals assigning requisition blocking codes are not knowledgeable, they select a code from a script - and make errors.  The end user is now in a loop of attempting to determine if there is an error in their data entry or an error in blocking code, then attempt to resolve. At no time after a requisition line item is blocked in error is the person who made that call put back into the process.  All of the work to resolve falls to the end users who must escalate.  Standard response by PTP - retraining. Resources change, the cycle repeats.   Engage in cross-functional dialog BEFORE the designs are set.  All other functions are expected to understand Procurement designs and SAP functionality; that expectation is not reciprocated by PTP.  Without strong SAP knowledge and an environment that cultivates it personnel will make wrong assumptions and decisions - through no fault other than they did not know what they did not know. Example:  part of the Ariba design requires a check box be set on a particular indicator.  Without it significant impact.  PTP personnel approach users about issues being seen with particular group of suppliers, then contact a resource with Maintenance who picked up phone for a 10 min phone call with the original project leader.  That resulted in confirmation of the design, and later initiative by one PTP resource found it was written into the IBM contract that personnel were responsible for that checkbox.  For months errors that require 6 - 8 steps to reverse & correct were occurring, work was underway for a new design.  The solution was already in place. But not known or enforced.   Please, please, please stop referencing in meetings the complaints, the input given in frustration to PTP by the folks in the field as NOISE.  That has been a common phrase for over a year now. Granted - in the big picture this is a minor thing.  But folks with 30+ years of service have commented on how that label negatively impacted their desire to keep trying to work through issues.  Not sure where \"noise\" fits in the concepts of inclusion and receptiveness to the views, observations & experience of others.  ",
