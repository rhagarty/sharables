{"date":"2018-01-01","text":"APAY  team is not really qualified. The actions are not taken on time. They are still asking \"Which posting key should we use for vendor booking\". I think this sentence really summarize their \"quality and skill level\". Even if processes are handed over, they act like they do not know/heard about it. Turkey is very exceptioanal country in point of tax and legal requirements point. It has very different and local procedures. However, APAY is trying to process bookings according to global procedure which Turkey does not fit in. For example Turkey has very detailed return invoice process because of e-invoice, however APAY just ignores it and tries to apply global process which does not work for Turkey at all. When we raised issue to higher level people, we do not even receive responds. Previous BPSC team was great but since IBM has taken over APAY, it is very dissapointing. Work quality is very low.","Id":"18.02","title":"Very Dissatisfied"}
