{"date":"2018-01-01","text":"If something is not right in the PR / PO or travel expense, it is often not clear what exactly needs to be done to make it right. Is there a specific guideline, so that we can make everything right from the first time? Every time we think it through, but still changes something from P2P so that it does not work again. Also invoices from our 3rd party service prodivers are paid very late. The reason is never clear and what we can do about it is that they are not paid on time. I&#39;ve already had a time when a 3rd party did not want to perform a certain service for us until a certain invoice was paid.","Id":"7.05","title":"No Title"}
