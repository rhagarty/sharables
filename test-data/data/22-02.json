{"date":"2018-01-01","text":"Quicker response time and more personal contact. We are one company, why not just a quick jabber message or pick-up the phone if there are questions etc...  Also when invoices are returned to suppliers, its not always clear what is the problem why they are returned,.  Emails come without a clear persons name, so no way of contacting them besides the functional mailbox. Takes all too long when your supplier is refusing to deliver because of unpaid invoices.  More clear communication is needed.","Id":"22.02","title":"Very Dissatisfied"}
